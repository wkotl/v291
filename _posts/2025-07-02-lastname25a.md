title: Detecting Arbitrary Planted Subgraphs in Random Graphs
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'The problems of detecting and recovering planted structures/subgraphs in
  Erdős-Rényi random graphs, have received significant attention over the past three
  decades, leading to many exciting results and mathematical techniques. However,
  prior work has largely focused on specific ad hoc planted structures and inferential
  settings, while a general theory has remained elusive. In this paper, we bridge
  this gap by investigating the detection of an \emph{arbitrary} planted subgraph
  $\Gamma = \Gamma_n$ in an Erdős-Rényi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n, q_n)$, where
  the edge probability within $\Gamma$ is $p_n$. We examine both the statistical and
  computational aspects of this problem and establish the following results. In the
  dense regime, where the edge probabilities $p_n$ and $q_n$ are fixed, we tightly
  characterize the information-theoretic and computational thresholds for detecting
  $\Gamma$, and provide conditions under which a computational-statistical gap arises.
  Most notably, these thresholds depend on $\Gamma$ only through its number of edges,
  maximum degree, and maximum subgraph density. Our lower and upper bounds are general
  and apply to any value of $p_n$ and $q_n$ as functions of $n$. Accordingly, we also
  analyze the sparse regime where $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$ and $p_n-q_n =\Theta(q_n)$,
  with $\alpha\in[0,2]$, as well as the critical regime where $p_n=1-o(1)$ and $q_n
  = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$, both of which have been widely studied, for specific choices
  of $\Gamma$. For these regimes, we show that our bounds are tight for all planted
  subgraphs investigated in the literature thus far—and many more. Finally, we identify
  conditions under which detection undergoes sharp phase transition, where the boundaries
  at which algorithms succeed or fail shift abruptly as a function of $q_n$.  '
